Scrabble Game Made through Java

This was a sophomore year final project for my Java based class. 
It's a scrabble game where two players can face off against each other.
The first player writes a word then the word is checked and a random letter is selected.
The second player then has to begin his word with that same letter.

At the time i didn't have the time to add a dictionary in order to spell check but I worked
with the assumption that people wouldn't be writing random words. A dictionary would be an
easy addition to this project as many libraries exist that add a dictionary function.

There's a scoring system put in place that keeps track of the points and at the end of the
round the two player's scores are summed up and whoever has the higher score wins.
